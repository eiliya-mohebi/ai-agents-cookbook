**Intelli-Agent-FastAPI** is a powerful, end-to-end multi-agent system designed for intelligent email automation. This project showcases a complete workflow from development to deployment, leveraging **FastAPI** for the backend, a multi-agent architecture for complex task handling, and **Docker** for seamless deployment.

## üöÄ Technical Deep Dive

This project is a complete ecosystem with a decoupled frontend and backend, orchestrated by a sophisticated multi-agent system.

### Backend (`/backend`)

The backend is a robust **FastAPI** application that serves as the core of the system.

- **API Routes**: The chat and agent interactions are managed through API routes defined in `backend/src/api/chat/routing.py`.
- **Database**: **PostgreSQL** is used for data persistence, with **SQLModel** for ORM operations. The database connection is managed in `backend/src/api/db.py`.
- **AI Services**: The AI logic is encapsulated in services that handle tasks like generating email messages. These services are defined in `backend/src/api/ai/services.py`.

### Frontend (`/gradio-ui`)

The user interface is built with **Gradio**, providing an intuitive way to interact with the multi-agent system.

- **UI Components**: The interface is defined in `gradio-ui/gradio_app.py` and includes text inputs for prompts, and outputs for the final response and generated email content.
- **API Interaction**: The Gradio app communicates with the FastAPI backend via HTTP requests, as seen in the `process_prompt` function.

### Deployment (`/compose.yaml`)

The entire application is containerized using **Docker**, making it easy to deploy and scale. The `compose.yaml` file defines the services for the backend, frontend, and database, and manages their networking and volumes.

## ü§ñ Multi-Agent System

The intelligence of this project lies in its multi-agent architecture, which is designed to handle complex queries by breaking them down into smaller, manageable tasks.

### Agents

- **Supervisor Agent**: This is the master agent that routes tasks to the appropriate specialist agent. It is created in `backend/src/api/ai/agents.py`.
- **Research Agent**: This agent is responsible for conducting research based on a user's query. It uses the `research_email` tool to gather information.
- **Email Agent**: This agent takes the researched information and formats it into a well-structured email. It has access to the `send_me_email` tool to dispatch the email.

### Tools

The agents are equipped with a set of tools that allow them to perform specific actions:

- **`research_email`**: This tool, defined in `backend/src/api/ai/tools.py`, is used by the Research Agent to generate email content based on a query.
- **`send_me_email`**: This tool allows the Email Agent to send emails. It is also defined in `backend/src/api/ai/tools.py`.
